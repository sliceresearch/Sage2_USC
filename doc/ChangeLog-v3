- Fixes issue #96 by having sabi launch using the host in the config
  file. This will require a recopy of the launch script. Easiest way to
  do this is delete the SAGE2_Media\sabiConfig folder and relaunch sabi

- Messing with the chalk package to colorize console output, maybe
  focusing on specific parts and making general output more useful?
  [Andrew Burks]

- Electron launching now works off of defaultWin-cfg rather than making
  a new one by adding the width and height variables to display 0
  (assumes electron only needs 1). Cfg is read before launch to get
  resolution and layout to pass params to bat file. File is also written
  adjusting display 0's height and width to specified layout values on
  Electron launch, or 1,1 for chrome to prevent scroll bars. For later
  consideration: removal of unnecessary code if it is assumed that
  Chrome is no longer used. [D K]

  variable. To be used in the UI. [Luc Renambot]

  [AndrewTBurks]
- Update three.js to v84. [Luc Renambot]
- Updating moment.js library. [Luc Renambot]
- Update to webix 4.1. [Luc Renambot]
- Only disable contextmenu for apps: so it works for other input boxes.
  [Luc Renambot]
- Seems Luc already did the work for it. Keeping his stuff instead. the
  defaultValue is more efficient than value. For some reason value
  wasn't sticking but defaultValue was. [D K]
- Passing the current URL of webview into the menu entries (keeps the
  value up to date during navigation) [Luc Renambot]

  be ok since the 2nd check is for watch?v= [D K]

  will play and pause yt videos now. However requires a double check,
  only tested on yt videos. Currently unable to aquire the forced event
  association as seen on google main search page. [D K]

  on youtube.com or google seach with youtube. [D K]

  Mateevitsi]
- Calvin site was updated: new method to retrieve the image inside the
  page. [Luc Renambot]
- Quick fix to prevent new apps from spawning underneath everything
  else. Partitions seems to have reserved the first 20 on the server,
  but this change was not reflected in display or UI. Unsure if there
  are other issues caused elsewhere. [Dylan Kobayashi]
- Fixed a problem in WebUI where partition highlight wasnt updated
  correctly due to a change in structure of the function in server.js.
